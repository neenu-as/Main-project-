#HEALTH MONITORING SYSTEM WITH SMART SURVEILLANCE



Here introduce an fall detection and anomaly detection system that incorporates ma-
chine learning and image processing methodologies. The system utilizes the existing we-
bcam within the premises or an additional camera to capture high-frequency images of the
elderly in real-time. These images are transmitted to a server, which employs a fall detec-
tion algorithm powered by machine learning to identify instances of falls. Upon detection,
the server promptly sends an alert message and shares the corresponding image with a
designated social network account, enhancing real-time monitoring for elderly individuals.
In addition to fall detection, the system provides a practical solution for medication
management. Caretakers, who play a crucial role in the care of elderly residents, can set
pill reminders and timely alarms using the system. This feature ensures that caregivers
do not forget medication times, facilitating the administration of medicines to the aged
individuals under their care.
The machine learning algorithms used in fall detection analyze various features ex-
tracted from the images, and when a machine learning classification approach is employed,
the calculated features are tested on a pre-trained model to ensure high accuracy and mini-
mize false alarms. This comprehensive system aims to support the organization in mitigat-
ing risks associated with the care of aged individuals, especially in situations with limited
caretakers.
By integrating fall detection, medication reminders, and timely alarms, this technolog-
ical solution not only addresses immediate concerns related to falls but also contributes to
a more holistic strategy for ensuring the safety, well-being, and health management of the
elderly residents. The system acts as a vigilant aid, providing timely alerts, critical infor-
mation, and support to caregivers, ultimately improving the overall quality of care for the
aged individuals within the organization.
